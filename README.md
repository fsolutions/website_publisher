## Running with Cron

The script is designed to run once and exit, making it perfect for scheduling with cron.

### Setting up a Cron Job

1. Open your crontab:
```bash
crontab -e
```

2. Add a line to run the script at your desired interval. For example, to run every 10 minutes:
```
*/10 * * * * cd /path/to/your/script/directory && /path/to/python /path/to/your/script/directory/telegram_wordpress_publisher.py >> /path/to/your/script/directory/cron.log 2>&1
```

3. Save and exit. The cron job will now run automatically at the specified interval.

### Common Cron Intervals

- Every 5 minutes: `*/5 * * * *`
- Every 10 minutes: `*/10 * * * *`
- Every 30 minutes: `*/30 * * * *`
- Every hour: `0 * * * *`
- Every 2 hours: `0 */2 * * *`
- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`

## Manual Usage

If you prefer to run the script manually:
```bash

1. Check your Telegram channel for new posts
2. When a new post is detected, it will:
   - Extract the text and any media
   - Format the content for WordPress
   - Create a new post on your WordPress site
